# Magic_8_Ball
This magic 8 Ball was originally based on a tutorial by "Barnacules Nerdgasm" on YouTube, but I have restructured the majority of the application by replacing if() {} else {} statements (which got messier as more if and else statements were added) with boolean-based sections. I've also added an April Fools function (rickroll), a bunch of songs accessible via nickname (they only open the YouTube Page for it, though, so why not just go to YouTube?). Soon, there will be a Discord section, too, and at that point, the app will have a new main menu for individual task selection.

Special thanks to Barnacules Nerdgasm for the project from which this was derived and edited over the course of multiple years.

Function list coming shortly!
